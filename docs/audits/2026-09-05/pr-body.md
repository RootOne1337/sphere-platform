## Problem and resulting behavior

Tenant users could escalate roles or delegate excessive API-key privileges,
device credentials were not consistently bound to the addressed device, and task
results/account selection crossed authorization boundaries. Android refresh and
agent HTTP contracts also disagreed with the backend.

The changes enforce delegation and device/tenant boundaries, persist and rotate
device refresh credentials, repair PC registration and agent HTTP contracts, and
support startup from an immutable image. Android transport cleanup is cancellation
safe and automatic HTTP credentials are limited to the management origin.

Duplicate DAG delivery now uses a durable receipt instead of cancelling and
repeating device actions. Terminal results remain in the Android journal until
the backend acknowledges its PostgreSQL commit. Failed DAGs remain failed, and
Redis failure cannot prevent committing the task result. Queue acquisition and
conditional release use atomic Lua; synchronous command waits have real deadlines
and ignore intermediate acknowledgements.

## Validation

- Android enterprise debug unit suite: **315 passed**.
- Backend/PC suite, excluding load and separate production regressions: **834 passed**.
- Dedicated loopback PostgreSQL/Redis regressions: **26 passed, 1 strict xfail**.
- Reproductions and before/after evidence are indexed in
  [the audit report](docs/audits/2026-09-05/AUDIT-REPORT.md).
- Tests cover PostgreSQL row/commit behavior, Redis atomicity and lost responses,
  tenant/device authorization, command duplicates, simulated process restart,
  storage failure, failed DB commit and Redis outage.

## Remaining blockers and rollout constraints

This remains an **ongoing draft audit**, not a production-readiness assertion.
The strict xfail is a confirmed defect: publishing a task to Redis before the
PostgreSQL transaction commits leaves ghost tasks on rollback. Durable task
dispatch/recovery, full RLS rollout, orchestrator/VPN/deployment defects and the
remaining component audit are still open.

Apply the device refresh migration before deploying the new backend; previously
issued refresh tokens require device re-enrollment. The command journal retains
512 receipts for seven days with a 1 MiB cap and rejects new DAGs when full.
Interrupted execution returns an explicit unknown-outcome failure; this does not
claim exactly-once effects. CPU/RAM/FPS, physical-device compatibility and 10–64
emulator capacity have not been measured.

A real APK-to-backend runtime test is incomplete: automatic approval review
rejected starting the isolated local API with `blocked by policy`; no workaround
was used. CI results must be read on the latest PR head; dependency/security work
is still open. No merge or deployment has been performed.

The report corrects the earlier ACK-discriminator assessment: the original main
WebSocket loop already supported untyped legacy acknowledgements. The explicit
type standardizes the contract; it does not prove all original replies were lost.
